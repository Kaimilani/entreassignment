    <p>1. How I currently feel about life is, well, I feel stuck and as if my life has come to an unwanted pause that is keeping me from moving forward.
        It really is not a good feeling and I know theres more out there for me and I know I am capable of doing something more for myself and my family.
        The only person holding me back is....ME! I have issues with staying on track and keeping the momentum moving forward.
