        <div class="box--item">1. How I currently feel about life is, well, I feel stuck and as if my life has come to an unwanted pause that is keeping me from moving forward.
            It really is not a good feeling and I know theres more out there for me and I know I am capable of doing something more for myself and my family.
            The only person holding me back is....ME! I have issues with staying on track and keeping the momentum moving forward.</div>
        

        <div class="box--item">2. The problems that would be solved by having my own business, would be, the freedom to have more time with myself and my family. Financial freedom
            with a successful business. Picking when and where to work. Not having to work as an employed slave and being able to make decisions for the business.

        </div> 
    
        <div class="box--item">3. Imagining my life a year from now has 2 possibilities. One is if my business is taking flight and I am having success, I could be living
            a much better life. Feeling like I am going somewhere and that there are endless possibilities. Second would be I am still in the same boat because for some reason
            there has been no momentum for me. Personally, I feel there should be greater success and movement towards greater things a year from now. As long as I continue to put
            in the work and have someone to keep me accountable. Having someone push you and keep you on track is something everyone needs. A mentor or a guide, someone whos not going
            to let you fall off the track and keep you moving towards something. No matter how small or big, one step at a time.

        <div class="box--item">4. I have missed plenty of opportunites by not changing my life sooner, haha, I mean ultimately I've put myself here. There are no excuses, I guess you
            could say it was laziness or not having the drive or the ability to follow through with the ideas. Let's call it fear of failure and fear of success, the unknown. It all
            comes down to the same thing, me, its all about me. Everything in life starts with me, if I cannot be mentally fit, then I will continue to do the same thing over and over again.
            A little something everyone likes to call "insanity". Pushing through barriers and other walls which stop me or you is something we all need to learn to do. I could write a book
            on all the things I have failed to do and all the things I could have done better or even achieved.
